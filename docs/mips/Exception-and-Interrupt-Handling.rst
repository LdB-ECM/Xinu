Exception and Interrupt Handling (MIPS)
=======================================

On MIPS processors, |EX| tilizes a interrupt handling system which
allows components to register custom interrupt handlers to the system
at runtime or fall-back to the default trap handler.

MIPS processors will jump to and execute code beginning at ``0x8000
0180`` when an exception or interrupt occurs. Code for handling traps
must occupy no more than ``0x20`` bytes at this location (eight
instructions), therefore Embedded Xinu uses three instructions to jump
to different code which will handle traps more robustly.

In order to handle exceptions (such as TLB misses) efficiently, Embedded
Xinu uses an interrupt vector system to quickly read the exception code,
load the registered exception handler, and jump to the handler. If any
of these steps do not exist, the handler will fall-back to the default
trap handler.

If an interrupt has occurred it is important to save the state of the
processor and handle the interrupt gracefully so the system can
continue running. Thus, if the interrupt handler was called by an
interrupt and not an exception, the code will save the state of the
processor and perform a similar lookup for interrupt handlers.
