About the Systems Laboratory
----------------------------

`Marquette <http://www.mu.edu/>`__'s `Systems Laboratory <Systems
Laboratory>`__, under the direction of `Dr. Dennis Brylow
<http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/>`__ in the `Department of
Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science
<http://www.mscs.mu.edu/>`__, is housed on the third floor of Cudahy
Hall.

The lab creates new tools and methods for building and studying complex
computer systems. Our emphasis is on embedded, real-time, and network
systems, with strong ties to the electrical and computer engineering
community, and the computer science education community. Current and
recent projects include:

- Experimental Embedded Networking Platform. Creation of laboratory
  infrastructure and software for research and education in the area of
  embedded networking appliances, particularly wireless routers and IP
  telephony. Collaboration with Cisco Systems Advanced Research Division.

- Experimental Embedded Operating System Laboratory. Creation of
  laboratory infrastructure and software for research and education in
  area of embedded operating systems. Collaboration with University of
  Buffalo and University of Mississippi, with funding from the `National
  Science Foundation <http://www.nsf.gov/>`__.

- Embedded Software Transactional Memory. Exploration of an innovative
  transactional memory model for guaranteeing process synchronization in
  embedded operating systems. Collaboration with Intel Research.

- Many-core Embedded Operating System Laboratory. A port of Embedded
  Xinu to the `48-core SCC processor
  <http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=1>`__.

The Systems Lab hosts undergraduate `REU <http://acm.mscs.mu.edu/reu>`__
(Research Experience for Undergraduates) students each summer, funded by
a variety of sources including MU's College of Arts and Sciences and the
`National Science Foundation <http://www.nsf.gov/>`__.
