Student Extended Xinu
=====================

Overview
--------

Having students integrate advanced operating systems features and
develop applications for a their own or a provided Xinu operating
system is one of the potential tracks presented for a professor that
is :doc:`teaching with Xinu <index>`.

Students will learn to extend an operating system by adding kernel level
and user level applications. Given a functional Embedded Xinu operating
system the students will have to understand and manipulate existing
operating system code to create additional operating system features. To
add more applications to the operating system students will have to
understand the interactions between the program in design and the
operating system's device and kernel interaction calls. Programming for
embedded devices allows students to engage in development on small
resource constrained environments. Through extending the existing
Embedded Xinu operating system a student learns to use and understand
code not written by the student and develops advanced operating system
concepts.

Course Outcomes
---------------

Course development can parallel learning objectives and topics
associated with many Operating Systems courses. [#acm2001]_

Topics
~~~~~~

-  Overview of operating systems
-  Operating system principles
-  Concurrency
-  Scheduling and dispatch
-  Memory management
-  Device management
-  Security and protection
-  File systems
-  Evaluating system performance

Learning Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Intimate knowledge of embedded devices.
-  Overview of the general and specific purpose of an operating system.
-  Understanding concurrency and state flow diagrams.
-  Understanding deadlock and starvation.
-  Understanding the use of memory and virtual memory.
-  Characteristics of serial and parallel devices.

Potential Course Structure
--------------------------

A course where having students integrate advanced operating systems
features and develop applications for a their own or a provided Xinu
operating system can be outlined to one similar to the one below. The
example course layout has the listed applied assignments as well as
several written assignments of problems developed with the textbook in
mind or taken from the textbook.
