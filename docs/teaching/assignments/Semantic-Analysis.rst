Assignment: Semantic Analysis
=============================

Overview
--------

In this project students implement a semantic analysis (type checking)
pass for our `Concurrent
MiniJava <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/cosc4400/Spring2011/ConcurrentMiniJava.html>`__
language.

Notes

Our `modifications to MiniJava

require an additional step for initializing the class and type
environments. The class environment must be initialized with a
type-descriptor containing each of the method types in class
:doc:`Xinu </teaching/Xinu-Helper-Class>`, and the type environment
must be initialized with a binding of identifier *Xinu* to this class
type. With this, the type checker can verify that external calls are
programmed properly and also verify that only external calls which the
compiler knows how to map to the underlying runtime are being used in
the program.
