Assignment: Basic Networking (``ping``)
=======================================

This assignment is a Xinu assignment allowing the student to more
firmly understand how an operating system works. This assignment is
part of the :doc:`/teaching/Student-Built-Xinu` track for professors that
:doc:`teaching with Xinu </teaching/index>`.  The entire working directory
containing your Xinu operating system will be submission for this
assignment.

Preparation
-----------

First, make a fresh copy of your work thus far::

 cp -R

Untar the new project files on top of this new directory::

 tar xvzf

You should now see the new project files in with your old files. Be certain to
``make clean`` before compiling for the first time.

The Xinu Shell
--------------

With the addition of a full-featured TTY driver in the previous
assignment, we can now add the command-line Xinu user interface, the
*Xinu Shell* to the system. The new tarball includes a new
subdirectory ``shell/`` that provides the I/O processing necessary to
parse user input and launch a small set of commands.  Several useful
commands are provided as examples. This assignment will be concerned
primarily with the **ping** and **pingserver** commands.

Ethernet Driver
---------------

This project tarball equips your Xinu kernel with a block-oriented,
asynchronous ethernet driver for the router's built-in BCM4713 network
interface. You are not required to modify the ethernet driver
(directory ``device/ether/``), but it wouldn't be a bad idea to
familiarize yourself with its workings. It follows the same standard
device abstraction as we have seen in the TTY and disk device drivers.

Debugging Tools
---------------

For your convenience, we have also provided a ``snoop()`` function in
``network/snoop.c``, which will attempt to provide human-readable
interpretations of packets when called. This is provided strictly for
debugging purposes. It takes a buffer that contains an ethernet packet
and a designated length and prints out various values as well as a
:wikipedia:`hexdump` of the packet.

Student Implementation
----------------------

Your task for this assignment is to implement a version of **ping**
that allows your main programs to send *echo request* packets to other
machines and allows other machines to send *echo requests* packets to
your allocated backend. This project can be split into two distinct
parts, the client and the server. You should first implement a server
that allows other machines to **ping** your backend while it is
running.  The second part of this project is to implement the client
side which will allow you to write a main process that can **ping**
other machines.  In each of these parts you will deal with two types
of ICMP packets, *echo request* and *echo reply* packets. The
*request* packets are sent from a client to a target machine that is
running a ping server. The *reply* packets are sent in response to a
client's request back to the client.

Echo Reply (Ping) Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ping Server is a process spawned by the **pingserver** shell
command to listen to the Ethernet device for ping requests and
construct correct replies. (See :wikipedia:`Echo Reply <Ping>`.) Due
to the simplified nature of packet de-multiplexing in our current
system, it will not be possible for your Xinu kernel to run both a
ping server and a ping client simultaneously. (The two processes will
"fight" over incoming packets.) Instead, use a second router to
generate ping requests to test your server, or use the Linux command
**ping** on a local server which has direct access to the private Xinu
Network.

Echo Request (Ping) Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project tarball includes a starter stub for a ping command in the
shell directory file ``shell/xsh_ping.c``. Your ping command should take
a single command-line argument consisting of a destination IP address in
dotted decimal notation. It should

-  generate a sequence of 20 (``MAX_REQUESTS`` in ``include/network.h``)
   ping packets at one second intervals;
-  watch for ping replies from the target machine;
-  print out replies received (see the ``icmp_reqreply`` function in
   ``network/icmp.c``); and
-  print out a summary of results.

The proper term for a "ping packet" is an :wikipedia:`ICMP
<Internet_Control_Message_Protocol>` :wikipedia:`Echo Request <Ping>` An
answering packet is an Echo Reply. For the sake of simplicity, this project will
not implement a full :wikipedia:`ARP <Address_Resolution_Protocol>` system to
resolve IP addresses down to underlying Ethernet :wikipedia:`MAC Addresses
<MAC_address>`.  Instead, we will use a predefined static table, ``arp_map`` to
match requested ping IP addresses for machines local to the private Xinu
Network. Any address that is not known to the ``arp_map`` table will be assumed
to be on another network, and the ping packet should instead be addressed to
Zardoz, the Xinu Network Gateway.  The gateway's MAC address is hard-coded in
``network.h`` with the constant ``PING_GATEWAY``.
