Building an Embedded Xinu laboratory
------------------------------------

In this section we are developing instructions so that other groups
can benefit from the work we are doing.  These guides can be followed
more or less in order to create a relatively inexpensive platform for
a custom operating system.  As our work develops further, there will
be more Xinu-specific information.

.. note::

    These instructions currently assume you are using the WRT54GL,
    WRT54Gv4, WRT54Gv8, or WL-330gE routers.
