About WinXINU
-------------

As part of a senior design project working in coordination with `Dr.
Dennis Brylow <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/>`__ a frontend interface
was successfully created for use under the a Windows operating system.
Project members include Adam Koehler, Nicholas McMillan, and Christopher
Swiderski, Matt Thomson. The software created incorporates the basic
functionality of the `UNIX variant toolset <XINU Console Tools>`__
allowing computers with a Windows operating system installed to directly
participate in the development and testing of the Embedded XINU
operating system. Version 1.0 of WinXINU was released on May 1, 2008.

WinXINU Development
-------------------

Initial Development
'''''''''''''''''''

-  Goal

   -  To design and develop frontend client that is graphically oriented
      and Windows compatible. This client should maintain all
      functionality of the currently implemented fronted software tools
      that run on any UNIX variant operating system. This will allow
      computers with the Windows XP or Windows Vista operating system
      installed to directly participate in the remote testing of
      Embedded XINU operating system kernels.

-  Subversion Repository

   -  https://xinu.mscs.mu.edu/svn/projects/windows-tools/

Continued Development
'''''''''''''''''''''

The continued development of WinXINU will bring the more advanced
entities of the XINU Console toolset to the Windows frontend client.
Along with the addition of more advanced features any fixes to bugs will
be processed within the Windows toolset subversion repository.
