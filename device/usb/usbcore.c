 *
 * This is the USB Core Driver.  It implements the USB system software that does
 * not depend on the specific host controller hardware and is not specific to
 * any single USB device or platform.
 *
 * Features and limitations:
 *
 *  - This driver is written to be compatible with USB 2.0.  USB 3.0 devices
 *    are untested.
 *
 *  - Not all USB transfer types and speeds are necessarily supported.  This
 *    depends on the Host Controller Driver; see usb_submit_xfer_request().
 *
 *  - This driver does not attempt to do any intelligent power management,
 *    bandwidth allocation, or transfer scheduling.  Devices are always set to
 *    their first listed configuration regardless of power requirements.
 *    Transfer requests are simply passed to the Host Controller Driver in the
 *    order submitted; thus, the Host Controller Driver is responsible for doing
 *    any more intelligent scheduling if desired.
 *
 *  - This driver is assumed to drive a single USB (bus).  Multiple USBs are not
 *    supported.
 *
 *  - This driver does not support multiple configurations per USB device.  If
 *    a device happens to have multiple configurations, the first one will be
 *    assigned.
 *
 *  - This driver is currently written to support binding drivers to USB
 *    devices rather than USB interfaces.
 *
 *  - By design, it is possible to implement a host controller driver for
 *    different host controller hardware without changing any of this code, as
 *    long as the host controller driver provides the functions declared in
 *    usb_hcdi.h.
 *
 *  - By design, this driver has a hard-coded dependency on the USB hub driver
 *    because USB is useless without hubs.
 *
 * To initialize this core USB driver, usbinit() must be called by the system
 * startup code.  See that function for details.
 *
 * The other functions exported by this core USB driver are mostly intended to
 * be used by USB device drivers.
 *
 * Debugging messages in this driver and in the rest of the USB code can be
 * enabled by changing the definitions of the minimum, initial, and/or
 * background log priorities in usb_util.h.

 * Submit a USB transfer request to be completed.
 *
 * This is intended to be an asynchronous interface where the transfer request
 * is queued for later processing by the Host Controller.  This function should
 * immediately return and the transfer request should be asynchronously
 * completed at some later time, making use of interrupts between the CPU and
 * host controller to accomplish this efficiently.  However, exactly how the
 * transfer request is completed is ultimately up to the Host Controller Driver.
 * Synchronous completion is possible, although not recommended.
 *
 * When the transfer has been completed or has failed, the @ref
 * usb_xfer_request::completion_cb_func "completion_cb_func" function of the @p
 * req will be called.  This callback function should process the completed or
 * failed request and either free its memory or re-submit it to start another
 * transfer.
 *
 * Not all USB transfer types and speeds are necessarily supported.  This
 * depends on the Host Controller Driver, which is expected to make sure each
 * request is supported when passed it and return ::USB_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
 * if not.  Currently, the Host Controller Driver for the Synopsys DesignWare
 * High-Speed USB 2.0 On-The-Go Controller (the one on the Raspberry Pi) is
 * intended to support control, bulk, and interrupt transfers at low, full, and
 * high speeds; however, not all combinations of transfers and speeds have
 * actually been tested yet.
