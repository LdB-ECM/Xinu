/**
 * @addtogroup usbhub
 *
 * This is the USB Hub driver. Hubs are one of the fundamental devices in USB
 * and are used to provide connection points (ports) for additional devices.
 * Note that even if no "external" hub is plugged in, the USB still will have at
 * least one logical hub (the root hub) and usually additional "internal" hubs.
 * That is, a USB is a tree of devices where the root node and all non-leaf
 * nodes are hubs.  A port on a USB hub may correspond to a port you can
 * physically plug a device into or may correspond to an internal port.
 *
 * This hub driver is an example of a USB device driver, but it is somewhat
 * special as it mandatory to include this driver if USB is supported at all.
 * This is because it would be impossible to access any USB devices if a hub
 * driver were not available.  This hub driver also uses some interfaces in the
 * core driver, such as usb_attach_device(), that are not useful to any other
 * USB device driver.
 *
 * The initial entry point of this USB hub driver is hub_bind_device(), which is
 * called when the USB core has configured a newly attached USB device that may
 * be a hub.  hub_bind_device() is responsible for checking if the device is a
 * hub, and if so, then doing hub-specific setup, including one-time driver
 * initialization, reading the hub descriptor, powering on the ports, and
 * submitting an asynchronous USB interrupt transfer request to the hub's status
 * change endpoint.
 *
 * Everything else this hub driver does happens asynchronously as a response to
 * a status change request being completed.  Every USB hub has exactly one IN
 * interrupt endpoint called the "status change endpoint".  The hub responds on
 * this endpoint whenever the status of the hub or one of the hub's ports has
 * changed--- for example, when a USB device has been connected or disconnected
 * from a port.
 *
 * At the hardware level, when a hub has data to send on its status change
 * endpoint, an interrupt will come in from the USB host controller.  This
 * eventually will result in the status change transfer being completed and
 * hub_status_changed() being called.  Thus, the detection of status changes is
 * interrupt-driven and is not implemented by polling at the software level.
 * (At the hardware level, USB is still a polled bus, but the host controller
 * hardware handles that for us.)  Upon detecting a status change on one or more
 * ports on a hub, the hub driver then must submit one or more control messages
 * to the hub to determine exactly what changed on the affected ports.  However,
 * we defer this work by passing it to a separate thread in order to avoid doing
 * too much synchronous work in interrupt handlers.
