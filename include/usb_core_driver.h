     * @ref usb_device::descriptor "device descriptor", or the available @ref
     * usb_device::interfaces "interfaces" and @ref usb_device::endpoints
     * "endpoints".
     *
     * If the USB device is indeed supported by the driver, this function must
     * do any necessary device-specific setup, such as configuring the device
     * with device-specific or class-specific control messages, and allocate any
     * needed resources, such as @ref ::usb_xfer_request

     * successful, ::USB_STATUS_SUCCESS must be returned; otherwise, any

     * can store per-device, driver-specific data in the @ref
     * usb_device::driver_private "driver_private" member of the USB device
     * structure.
     *
     * This function may continue to be called by the USB core with @a different
     * USB devices even after the driver has been successfully bound to a USB
     * device.  If the driver does not support controlling multiple USB devices
     * simultaneously, this function must return ::USB_STATUS_DEVICE_UNSUPPORTED

     * for device drivers to choose a different configuration.

     * ensures that any attempt to submit transfers to the device with either
