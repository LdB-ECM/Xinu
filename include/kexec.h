 * Kernel execute: transfer control to a new kernel.  This is intended to be
 * used to allow Xinu to act as a bootloader, e.g. so that a new Xinu kernel can
 * be executed without rebooting the hardware.
 *
 * This is a platform-dependent system call and may not be available on a given
 * platform.  Furthermore, the new kernel must be valid to execute on the given
 * platform.  This may include being linked to run at a certain address.
