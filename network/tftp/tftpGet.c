/**
 * @ingroup tftp
 *
 * Download a file from a remote server using TFTP and passes its contents,
 * block-by-block, to a callback function.  This callback function can do
 * whatever it wants with the file data, such as store it all into a buffer or
 * write it to persistent storage.
 *
 * @param[in] filename
 *      Name of the file to download.
 * @param[in] local_ip
 *      Local protocol address to use for the connection.
 * @param[in] server_ip
 *      Remote protocol address to use for the connection (address of TFTP
 *      server).
 * @param[in] recvDataFunc
 *      Callback function that will be passed the file data block-by-block.  For
 *      each call of the callback function, the @p data (first) argument will be
 *      set to a pointer to the next block of data and the @p len (second)
 *      argument will be set to the block's length.  All data blocks will be the
 *      same size, except possibly the last, which can be anywhere from 0 bytes
 *      up to the size of the previous block(s) if any.
 *      <br/>
 *      In the current implementation, the block size (other than possibly for
 *      the last block) is fixed at 512 bytes.  However, implementations of this
 *      callback SHOULD handle larger block sizes since tftpGet() could be
 *      extended to support TFTP block size negotiation.
 *      <br/>
 *      This callback is expected to return ::OK if successful.  If it does not
 *      return ::OK, the TFTP transfer is aborted and tftpGet() returns this
 *      value.
 * @param[in] recvDataCtx
 *      Extra parameter that will be passed literally to @p recvDataFunc.
 *
 * @return
 *      ::OK on success; ::SYSERR if the TFTP transfer times out or fails, or if
 *      one of several other errors occur; or the value returned by @p
 *      recvDataFunc, if it was not ::OK.

    /* Allocate and open a UDP device (socket) to communicate with the TFTP
     * server on.  The local and remote protocol addresses are specified as
     * required parameters to this function.  The local port, which corresponds
     * to the client's TFTP Transfer Identifier (TID) as per RFC 1350, must be
     * allocated randomly; the UDP code handles this if 0 is passed as the local
     * port.  The remote port is always initially the well-known TFTP port (69),
     * but after receiving the first data packet it must be changed to the port
     * on which the server actually responded.
     *
     * However... the last point about the server responding on a different port
     * (which is unavoidable; it's how TFTP is designed) complicates things
     * significantly.  This is because the UDP code will *not* route the
     * server's response to the initial UDP device, as this device will be bound
     * to port 69, not the actual port the server responded on.  To work around
     * this problem without manually dealing with UDP headers, we create a
     * *second* UDP device, which initially listens on the port from which the
     * client sends the initial RRQ, but is initially *not* bound to any remote
     * port or address.  We then set UDP_FLAG_BINDFIRST on this second UDP
     * device so that the remote port and address are automatically filled in
     * when the response from the server is received.  Further packets sent from
     * the server are then received on this second UDP device, while further
     * packets sent from the client are then sent over this second UDP device
     * rather than the first since the second has the remote port correctly set.
